# GraphExplorationComplexityReduction
The Graph Exploration and Complexity Reduction Framework is a research prototype to enable studying of possibilities to support human users to understand and explore large data sets. The Complexity Reduction is based upon a combination of graph-theoric metrics, for example, centrality measures, and community detection/clustering algorithms, for example, k-means, to select representative data points (nodes/vertices).

The research and development is being done at the Telecooperation Lab at TU Darmstadt by **Suhas Bhairav** in the context of his master's thesis and **Tim Grube** as part of his BMBF funded project **KomBi** as part of his Software Campus participation.
